This repository contains the LAURA Virtual Machine (VM) ready to use with the technological choises initially proposed by LAURA Project Team and two tutorials. The first tutorial presents a guide for anyone which intends to use LAURA to develop its final application, being necessary only to configure according to the type of hardware platform used and to the network design and aspects related to the final application. The second tutorial presents a guide for those who want to modify or create a new VM, according to the requirements and technological choices made by stakeholders responsible for the development of the final application.
